# Coffee Run

This is the second project created in Front-End Web Development: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide. It introduces you to some basic javascript ( objects and ES5 modules ), Bootstrap, and JQuery. It also does a great job of showing you how to setup event handlers and how to structure them so they have intrinsic functionality and can also be passed additional functionality for your application to execute. 

## More Details

The project is a front end coffee ordering page. You create an object ([datastore](scripts/datastore.js)) to track customer orders and a form to take customer orders. It also contains a pending orders section which allows you to remove pending orders by clicking on them.

## Takeaways

For me the most important thing I took from this is the importance of keeping your modules separate and succinct. Seeing this showed me how much this can aid in testing.

Another important lesson I learned from this was how to structure event handlers. I think understanding the structure provided during this exercise will help me better organize my applicaions in the future.
