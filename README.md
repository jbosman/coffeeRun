# Coffee Run

This is the second project created in Front-End Web Development: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide. It introduces you to some basic javascript ( objects and ES5 modules ), Bootstrap, and JQuery. 

## More Details

The project is a front end coffee ordering page. You create an object ([datastore](scripts/datastore.js)) to track customer orders and a form to take cusomter orders.

## Takeaways

For me the most important thing I took from this is the importance of keeping your modules separate and succinct. Seeing this showed me how much this can aid in testing.
